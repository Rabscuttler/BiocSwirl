  Author: Elizabeth Hutchins
  Type: Standard
  Version: 1.0

#Introduction

- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to the lesson on snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq. Most tools and workflows are written for scRNA-seq data, but there are some differences on the analysis end. This lesson will help you identify characteristics of snRNA-seq data to be aware of for analysis.

#Mitochondrial rRNA content

- Class: text
  Output: For this lesson, we will assume that you have already finished the low-level analyses lessons in the scRNA-seq course.

- Class: text
  Output: Mitochondrial rRNA content is often included as part of data filtering with scRNA-seq data in tools such as Seurat; low quality/dying cells often exhibit mitochondrial contamination.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which method results in cells with a higher mitochondrial rRNA content?
