# Normalization

- Class: text
  Output: There are many factors to account for which contribute to the number of reads mapped to a gene. Such factors include gene length, GC content, and sequencing depth; during library prep, variability in number of molecules sequenced between samples may contribute to different total read counts for different samples. Normalization is therefore an essential step when converting raw read counts to gene expression values.

- Class: text
  Output: Normalization methods can be categorized into several types - Normalization by library size, normalization by distribution, and normalization by controls. Proceed to learn more about each method.

- Class: text
  Output: Normalization by library size removes differences in sequencing depth by dividing total number of reads in each sample. It assumes that the amount of total expression is the same under different experimental conditions. Reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) and fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads (FPKM) are common methods that normalize by library size.

- Class: text
  Output: Normalization by distribution equilibrates expression levels for non-DE genes by comparing distributions of read counts across samples. This method assumes that DE and non-DE genes behave the same, and that there is roughly balanced expression across conditions.

- Class: text
  Output: Normalization by controls uses control genes which are not affected by biological conditions but the same amount of control molecules are present. A disparity in the number of control molecules sequenced allows for normalization.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Our sample data was normalized by library size. RPKM data was generated by aligning 100bp single-end reads using RSEM to the mm10 mouse genome. How would you import the file genes_rpkm.csv containing RPKM values into a pandas dataframe?
  CorrectAnswer: pd.read_csv("genes_rpkm.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pd.read_csv("genes_rpkm.csv")')
  Hint: Import using pd.read_csv.
